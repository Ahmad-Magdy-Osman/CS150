Python, Functions, Files, Strings, Formatting, Lists, Dictionaries, Encryption, Turtle Graphic, Classes.

I took this class in Fall 2016. Each folder is its own project/exercise. Each folder in this repository explores a topic on its own. The projects/exercises are all in Python and can be walked through easily. Feel free to clone this repository and to explore the projects.
